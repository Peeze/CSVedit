# CSVedit
Little tool to edit CSV data in the console.

# Work in progress
Currently, a simple CSV class is implemented. It contains the data as an array
of arrays. The class is already able to read in comma-seperated files, including
syntax to escape delimiters with backslash or quotes. Also, a CSV instance can
be passed to an outstream in more human-readable.
